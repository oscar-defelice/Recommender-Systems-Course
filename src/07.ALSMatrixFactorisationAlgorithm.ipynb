    "# Matrix Factorisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The __Alternating Least Squares__ algorithm is a popular technique used in recommender systems for collaborative filtering. \n",
    "As you might remember, collaborative filtering is a technique that uses the past behaviour of users to make recommendations for new items. \n",
    "The goal of the ALS algorithm is to factorise a user-item matrix into two matrices, one representing the users and the other representing the items, so that the dot product of the two matrices approximates the original matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ALS algorithm works by alternately fixing one of the matrices while optimising the other. \n",
    "Specifically, it alternates between fixing the user matrix and optimising the item matrix and fixing the item matrix and optimising the user matrix. This alternating process continues until a certain convergence criteria is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimisation process involves minimising the difference between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings in the user-item matrix. This is done by computing the _least squares_ solution for each matrix. The algorithm uses a regularization term to prevent overfitting and ensure that the solution is stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ALS algorithm can handle large and sparse datasets by breaking down the computation into smaller sub-problems. This allows the algorithm to scale to millions of users and items. The algorithm can also handle implicit feedback data where the absence of a rating is not necessarily a negative signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further advantage of the ALS algorithm is that it is computationally efficient and can be parallelized easily. This makes it suitable for large-scale recommender systems used by companies such as Amazon and Netflix. The algorithm is also robust to noise and can handle missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one limitation of the ALS algorithm is that it assumes that the user-item matrix can be factorised into two matrices. This assumption may not hold in some cases, leading to poor recommendations. Additionally, the ALS algorithm may not perform well in situations where there are few ratings for each user or item.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the ALS algorithm is a widely used technique in collaborative filtering-based recommender systems. It is computationally efficient, scalable, and can handle large and sparse datasets. However, it may not perform well in all situations and its assumptions may not hold in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A common problem \n",
    "\n",
    "In all the algorithms for recommender systems we have seen up to this point, we could find some common issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Popularity bias_: recommendations were imbalanced towards the most \"popular\" items, the ones with a great number of ratings. In general, this refers to system recommends the movies with the most interactions without any personalisation.\n",
    "2. _Cold start_: recommendations for users, items or both with a low number of ratings were not really accurate. In general, this refers to when movies added to the catalogue have either none or very little interactions while recommender rely on the movie’s interactions to make recommendations.\n",
    "3. _Scalability issue_: if the underlying training database is too large, we would struggle to fit our model. In generale, this refers to the lack of ability to scale to much larger sets of data when more and more users and movies got added into our database.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the three above are very typical challenges for collaborative filtering recommender. \n",
    "\n",
    "They arrive naturally along with the user-movie (or movie-user) interaction matrix where each entry records an interaction of a user $i$ and a movie $j$. In a real world setting, the vast majority of movies receive very few or even no ratings at all by users. We are looking at an extremely sparse matrix with more than $99\\%$ of entries are missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "With such a sparse matrix, what ML algorithm can be trained and reliable to make inference? \n",
    "\n",
    "To find solutions to the question, we are effectively solving a data sparsity problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix Factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "In collaborative filtering, matrix factorisation is the state-of-the-art solution for sparse data problem, although it has become widely known since [Netflix Prize Challenge](https://www.netflixprize.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img width=\"650\" src=\"https://sigopt.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/collaborative_filtering.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorisation is a family of mathematical operations for matrices in linear algebra. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be specific, a matrix factorisation is a decomposition of a matrix $A$ into a product of matrices $B, C$ of suitable dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A \\simeq B \\times C \\, .$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of collaborative filtering, matrix factorization algorithms work by decomposing the user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices. \n",
    "One matrix can be seen as the user matrix where rows represent users and columns are latent factors. \n",
    "The other matrix is the item matrix where rows are latent factors and columns represent items.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does matrix factorisation solve our problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several aspects of matrix factorisation that can be exploited to solve the issues described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The matrix factorisation-based model learns the user-item interaction matrix factorisation by user and item representation matrices. This allows the model to predict better personalised movie ratings for users. (Addresses Popularity bias and cold start)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. With matrix factorisation, less-known items can have the same rich latent representation of \"popular\" ones. This improves recommender's ability to suggest less-known movies. (Addresses Popularity bias)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Matrix factorisation algorithm is really efficient at prediction time, since it is just a matter of multiplying two matrices. (Addresses scalability issue)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The matrix factorisation algorithm is parallelisable. (Addresses scalability issue)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternating Least Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen how FunkSVD can be used to factorise the matrix of ratings into tow pieces that can be interpreted as users and items features.\n",
    "\n",
    "FunkSVD and ALS are both matrix factorisation algorithms used for collaborative filtering in recommendation systems. However, they use different approaches to factorise the original ratings matrix into two low-rank matrices representing users and items.\n",
    "\n",
    "As exposed previously, FunkSVD minimises the squared error between the original ratings matrix and the reconstructed matrix as a sum of element-wise squared differences. It updates the user and item matrices using gradient descent to minimize this objective function. The algorithm works by computing the difference between the ratings matrix and the dot product of user and item matrices, then computing the gradient of the objective function with respect to each matrix, and updating the matrices accordingly. This process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, __ALS__ (__Alternating Least Squares__) algorithm aims to minimise the same squared error objective function as FunkSVD but approaches the minimisation problem using an alternating least squares method. The algorithm works by first fixing the user matrix and minimising the objective function with respect to the item matrix, then fixing the item matrix and minimising the objective function with respect to the user matrix. This process is repeated until convergence. In each iteration, the algorithm solves a least squares problem to update the user or item matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, if $Y$ is the ratings matrix, $\\mathcal{H}_u$ is the user matrix, and $\\mathcal{H}_m$ is the item matrix, then FunkSVD solves the following optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\underset{\\mathcal{H}_u,\\mathcal{H}_m}{\\mathrm{argmin}} \\sum_{ij}(y_{ij} - \\mathcal{H}_{u,i} \\cdot \\mathcal{H}_{m,j})^2 \\, .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "whereas ALS alternatively solves the following two least squares problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{H}_u = \\underset{\\mathcal{H}_u}{\\mathrm{argmin}} \\sum_{ij}(y_{ij} - \\mathcal{H}_{u,i} \\cdot \\mathcal{H}_{m,j})^2  \\, ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{H}_m = \\underset{\\mathcal{H}_,}{\\mathrm{argmin}} \\sum_{ij}(y_{ij} - \\mathcal{H}_{u,i} \\cdot \\mathcal{H}_{m,j})^2  \\, .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{H}_u$ and $\\mathcal{H}_m$ are updated alternatively until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple introduction to the subject can be found in [this nice blog post](https://sophwats.github.io/2018-04-05-gentle-als.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Apache Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system that allows processing large-scale data sets in parallel across a cluster of computers. It provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark is convenient for large datasets because it can handle big data processing in a fast, distributed, and fault-tolerant way. It enables users to process data in parallel across a cluster of machines, which allows for faster processing times. Additionally, Apache Spark can handle various types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, which makes it a versatile tool for data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark is designed to operate in-memory, meaning that it can keep the data in memory, rather than constantly writing to disk, which results in faster processing times. This in-memory processing feature, combined with the distributed nature of Spark, makes it a convenient tool for handling large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminologies\n",
    "\n",
    "There are certain terminologies which needs to be understood before moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Apache Spark__: Apache Spark is an open-source distributed general-purpose cluster-computing framework.It can be used with Hadoop too.\n",
    "* __Collaborative filtering__: Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users. Consider example if a person A likes item 1, 2, 3 and B like 2,3,4 then they have similar interests and A should like item 4 and B should like item 1.\n",
    "* __Alternating least square (ALS) matrix factorisation__: The idea is basically to take a large (or potentially huge) matrix and factor it into some smaller representation of the original matrix through alternating least squares. We end up with two or more lower dimensional matrices whose product equals the original one. ALS comes in-built in Apache Spark.\n",
    "* __PySpark__: PySpark is the collaboration of Apache Spark and Python. PySpark is the Python API for Spark. It allows Python programmers to harness the power of Spark for big data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are going to implement a simple recommendation system using PySpark. \n",
    "With no further ado, let's get started."

    "### Difference between Spark Dataframe and Pandas Dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas and Spark dataframes are both tabular data structures, but they have some differences in terms of functionality and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "As known, Pandas is a Python library that provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. The main data structure in Pandas is the DataFrame, which is a two-dimensional table with rows and columns. Pandas dataframes are stored in memory and can be manipulated using a wide range of functions and methods. Pandas is well-suited for working with datasets that fit into memory on a single machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Spark is a distributed computing framework that provides an interface for programming cluster computing with a focus on big data processing. Spark provides a distributed data processing framework that can handle large datasets by distributing the data across a cluster of machines. Spark uses a data abstraction called _Resilient Distributed Datasets_ (RDDs) which is a fault-tolerant collection of elements that can be operated on in parallel. Spark's primary data abstraction for structured data processing is the DataFrame. Spark DataFrames are similar to Pandas DataFrames in terms of functionality, but they are distributed across a cluster of machines and stored in a distributed file system like _Hadoop Distributed File System_ (HDFS).\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, some key differences between Pandas and Spark dataframes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data size**: Pandas is designed to handle datasets that fit into memory on a single machine, while Spark can handle much larger datasets by distributing the data across a cluster of machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data processing**: Spark is designed for distributed computing and can process data in parallel across a cluster of machines. Pandas can only process data on a single machine, but it provides a wide range of functions and methods for manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data storage**: Pandas dataframes are stored in memory, while Spark dataframes are stored in a distributed file system like HDFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance**: Spark can be faster than Pandas when processing large datasets due to its ability to distribute the computation across a cluster of machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Pandas is great for working with small to medium-sized datasets that can fit into memory on a single machine, while Spark is ideal for working with large datasets that require distributed computing across a cluster of machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, it should be quite clear why we want to model our recommendation system using Spark. We want to be able to handle large datasets, and Spark is the perfect tool for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's select the appropriate columns from the dataset and filter them from the Spark dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, we do not need all the columns present in the dataframe. Only `asin` which is ProductID, `reviewerID` and `overall` (the rating given by users to each product) is required."
