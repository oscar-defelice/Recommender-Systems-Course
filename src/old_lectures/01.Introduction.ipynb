    "## The Power of Recommendation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation systems are one of the most useful applications of machine learning and nowadays it seems to take more and more place in our lives. There are many web-services like YouTube, Amazon, Netflix or Spotify running powerful recommendation engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a general way, _recommendation systems are algorithms which suggests relevant items to users_. For example: movies to watch on your Netflix account, or products to buy on your Amazon account, or videos to watch on YouTube, or music to listen on Spotify, or anything else depending on the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, customers are faced with multiple choices because there are millions of products available online and recommendation sections help them to find desired ones. It is something we cannot imagine modern e-Commerce or online media without it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Personalised vs non-personalised recommender systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The most general split we can do about recommender systems is in two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Personalised\n",
    "2. Non-Personalised\n",
    "\n",
    "### Personalised recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Giving a personalised recommendation to the user requires to know specific information about this user. You should know what are the features of products that this user likes or dislikes according to his past behaviour and purchasing history on your web-site.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: You should know what kind of movies I liked based on my historical movie ratings (for example I like Sci-Fi movies) and according to this information you can recommend moves that I might like. You can find movies which have high chance to be liked by me in a two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Item to item similarity_: Suggest me to watch other movies which are similar to the movies I already liked (which items are similar to the items I already liked).\n",
    "2. _User to user similarity_: Suggest me to watch other movies that users which are similar to me have already liked and I have not seen yet (which user is similar to me according to my and his historical behaviour/interest).\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarise what personalised recommendation system tries to do in a simple way, before we deep dive into this topic in the next lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predicts the rating the user may give to the products which he has not tried yet. Predictions are made based on user’s taste and preferences which is designed according to his historical behaviour on your web-site (purchased items, ratings or some other interactions).\n",
    "* Sorts the products according to the predicted rating in descending order and recommends top N items from this list to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "So as you can see in personalised systems users individual likes and dislikes (historical ratings) are considered to generate customised recommendations for them. There can be two kind of users rating:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explicit Ratings**: If user can rate something that he purchased on your web-site, you have explicit ratings. It is direct information from users, so you are $100\\%$ accurate how they liked products/services which they purchased. For example on Amazon one can rate items it has purchased.\n",
    "2. **Implicit Ratings**: If you do not have web-site like Amazon where users can directly rate some items or if your customers do not use this functionality and you have many items that are unrated, you can use _implicit ratings_. Imagine, you have an online gambling web-site where people can play some games, you can think about things which might means that they liked a game or not. For instance: time or money spent on this game compared to another game. Or if you have a web-site where you are selling the tickets of bus, theatre, events or something else you can say that if user purchased something it also means that they liked it without extra explorations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further logical split of recommender system models can be the one making reference to three categories: **content based systems**, **collaborative filtering systems**, and **hybrid systems** (which use a combination of the other two).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img width=\"1392\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49638680/216650290-e870bf29-e4dc-49de-9cd1-33cbdf2b38f2.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content based systems** use item features in order to recommend objects with similar properties. \n",
    "On the other hand, **Collaborative filtering systems** build a model from users' past behaviours, as well as decision made by similar users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Personalised Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Personalised recommendations means we do not need to know specific information about the users preferences. So if the historical data of users ratings or purchases are not available one cannot generate customised recommendation for them. That does not mean that this kind of recommendations are less important. There are several examples of non-personalised recommendations that show interesting content.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img width=\"565\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49638680/210537437-0f3a31c5-89cf-4bc2-bf45-821537c735e3.png\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The most simple non-personalised recommendations are based on items popularity. A recommendation comes from what people like. \n",
    "For example: you are suggesting to watch the movie _Titanic_ for all of your customers because _Titanic_ is one of the most popular movie and you hope that it will be also interesting for those who have not seen yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am sure you have seen recommendations of popular items like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Best-seller\n",
    "2. Most popular\n",
    "3. Trending hot\n",
    "4. Best-liked\n",
    "5. Selling fast\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other kinds of non-personalised recommendations which are commonly used in e-commerce. They look more like a rule: \n",
    "\n",
    "> “People who buy X also buy Y”. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: People who bought phone also bought phone cover. So if you are buying a phone, they will likely recommend you to add the corresponding phone cover in your basket.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of recommendation is non-personalised because they are not using your individual ratings/taste or preferences to recommend you the phone cover. Instead, they know that phone and phone cover are associated items, because they are frequently bought together.\n"
