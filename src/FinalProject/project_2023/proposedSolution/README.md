# Proposed Solution

The aim of the final project was to give the opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired during the course to a real-world problem.

The solution proposed here is a hybrid recommender system that integrates collaborative filtering with content-based recommendations to improve overall recommendation quality.

## Solution Outline

### Understanding the Business Problem

- **Objective**: Enhance user experience by providing personalised restaurant recommendations.
- **Key Questions**:
  - How can we use customer location, restaurant information, and order history to predict restaurant preferences?
  - What factors influence a customer's decision to order from a specific restaurant?

### Data Exploration and Preparation

- **Data Collection**: Download and load the data files provided.
- **Data Understanding**:
  - Analyse the datasets to understand the features and the relationships between them.
  - Identify missing values, outliers, and categorical variables that need encoding.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handle missing values and outliers.
  - Encode categorical variables.
  - Normalise or standardise numerical features if necessary.

### Feature Engineering

- **Feature Creation**:
  - Generate new features that might be helpful for the model, such as distance between customer location and restaurant, order frequency, and popular times for ordering.
- **Feature Selection**:
  - Use correlation analysis, mutual information, or feature importance from model to select relevant features.

### Model Development

- **Model Selection**:
  - Consider models suitable for recommendation systems, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models.
- **Model Training**:
  - Split the data into training and validation sets.
  - Train models and tune hyperparameters using cross-validation.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Evaluate model performance using the F1 score as the primary metric.
  - Consider also measuring precision and recall to understand model behaviour.

### Model Refinement and Finalisation

- **Model Refinement**:
  - Use insights from the evaluation phase to refine the model. This may include feature engineering adjustments or trying different model architectures.
- **Model Testing**:
  - Test the final model on a separate test set to estimate how it will perform in real-world scenarios.

### Deployment and Monitoring

- **Deployment**:
  - Deploy the model in a simulated or real environment where the client can use it to make recommendations.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
  - Monitor the model's performance over time to catch any degradation in prediction quality.
  - Plan for periodic retraining of the model with new data.

### Presentation and Documentation

- **Presentation**:
  - Prepare a presentation of your findings, methodology, model performance, and recommendations for the client and data science team.
- **Documentation**:
  - Document the project, including data exploration findings, model development process, final model configuration, and deployment strategy.
